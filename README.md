## Overview

This project is a fully responsive web application designed to display a venue's menu items and manage a shopping cart. It is built using modern web technologies including Next.js, React, Redux, and RadixUI. The application fetches menu data from an external API, displays it, and allows users to add, remove, and manage items in their cart. The user interface is optimized for both mobile and desktop users.
